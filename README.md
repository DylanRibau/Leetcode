# Leetcode Questions

## Search a 2D Matrix
[Solution](/Search2DMatrix/main.go)

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

## Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
[Solution](/FindFirstAndLastPositionElementSortedArray/main.go)

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
